    <h1>üê¶ Welcome to the 2019 Bird Shirt challenge üê¶</h1>
    </br>

<body>
    <p>On 26th July it's Bird shirt Friday, so to celebrate I've designed this bird shirt challenge to raise money for the <strong><a href="https://www.rspb.org.uk/">RSPB</a></strong>.</p>
    <br>
    <p>To enter into the challenge, simply find the answers to all 10 questions and add them to the <strong>Google Form</strong> mentioned in <strong>Slack</strong>, along with a donation of at least <strong>¬£1</strong> either directly to Keith, or through the PayPal link.</p>
    <p>All donations will go straight to the RSPB. For further details on entry, refer to the Slack announcement!</p>
    <br>
    <p>I will be checking the results on Friday where:</p>
    <p>The first 3 people to have donated and correctly filled out the form will win a very special <strong>Bird Clip</strong>.</p>
    <p>All entrant names will be placed into a hat, and the randomly selected individual will win a <strong>¬£10 Amazon Voucher</strong>!</p>    
    <br>
    <p>Explanations and hints for each challenge will be detailed throughout the week, so if you get stuck at any stage you should be able to jump back in later on!</p>
    <br>
    <p>Good luck!</p>
